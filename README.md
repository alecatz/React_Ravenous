This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

**Ravenous** is a Yelp-like business-searching web application that uses real data from Yelp's public API.

The project relies on knowledge of React components, state, and props to pass search information to the Yelp API,
and return a list of results with the desired restaurant information.
